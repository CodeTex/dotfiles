description: Quick code review with actionable feedback
---

Review the following code. Be direct and focus on:

1. **Bugs or correctness issues** (highest priority)
2. **Unclear or misleading code** (readability)
3. **Missed edge cases** (robustness)
4. **Unnecessary complexity** (simplification opportunities)

Skip praise. Skip style nitpicks unless they hurt readability. If the code is fine, say so briefly.
